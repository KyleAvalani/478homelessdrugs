# Project Description
A written, non-technical description of our project.

### What is the purpose of your research project?
The purpose of our project is to analyze the links between overdose and homeless populations in WA state. We will determine whether the conditions of homelessness (such as sheltered, unsheltered, and being a veteran) correlates to the prevalence of overdoses across each county.

### What other research has been done in this area? Make sure to include 3+ links to related works.

### What is the dataset you'll be working with?  Please include background on who collected the data, where you accessed it, and any additional information we should know about how this data came to be.

We'll be working with two datasets.

The first is *'Washington State Residents Drug Overdose Quarterly Report'* for the year of 2018. This data is made public on the Washington State Department of Health website. The deaths and hospitalization data from this report are taken from the DOHâ€™s Death Certificates and Comprehensive Hospital Abstract Reporting System (CHARS)

The second dataset we're looking at is the Washington State Department of Commerce's *'2018 Point in Time Detailed County Results'*. This data details the conditions and prevalence of homelessness across Washington counties. By the 'Homeless Housing and Assistance Act', it is required for each county in Washington State to conduct an annual point-in-time count of sheltered and unsheltered homeless persons.

### Who is your target audience?  Depending on the domain of your data, there may be a variety of audiences interested in using the dataset. You should hone in on one of these audiences.

Our target audience is Homeless Assistance programs. Insight into the connection between overdoses and homelessness will allow assistance programs to better allocate their health resources.

### What should your audience learn from your resource? Please consider specific questions that your project can answer using the data you have identified (that are related to the overarching purpose)

From our resource, the audience will learn:

* Which kinds of homeless people are most affected by drug overdose? This will aid Homeless Assistance programs in knowing which category of homeless people to target for rehabilitation.
* Which types of drugs are the most prevalent in the overdoses of homeless people?
* Which types of drug overdoses are prevalent in each county?
* 

# Technical Description
A technical description of the tools and datasets we'll be using.

### What will be the format of your final product (Shiny app, HTML page, compiled .Rmd file, etc)?
We are going to be publishing our report as a Shiny app. 

### Do you anticipate any specific data collection / data management challenges?
We believe that we've collected enough data to analyze and gain insight from. If we find ourselves needing more data, it is certainly doable to gather more.

We anticipate a challenge in combining our datasets into one, cohesive table.

### What new technical skills will need to learn in order to complete your project?

### What major challenges do you anticipate? 
It will be difficult to opitmize how are data is displayed. What is the best way to show counts of homelessness along with counts of overdoses on a map? We must ensure that our interactive map is not too cluttered, but at the same time, shows enough data to actually be useful.
